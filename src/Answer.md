### Question 1: Which out of the two components (which are performing the same functionality) is performing better and how?

#### Ans:

Pure component performs a bit better when compared to the simple component because pure component will not re render the component if the values of the component is same and similar, which reduces unnecessary load on the computer and makes it good for working with large components.
